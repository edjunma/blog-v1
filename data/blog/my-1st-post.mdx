# The First Post

This is my 1st blog post on this blog to keep track of my own accountability starting from this day on May 31st, 2022. I will strive to post at least once a week about what I've learned from my journey from food, code, dogs, just the things I would love to share and look back upon.

Features images served using `next/image` component. The locally stored images are located in a folder with the following path: `/static/images/canada/[filename].jpg`

Since we are using mdx, we can create a simple responsive flexbox grid to display our images with a few tailwind css classes.
