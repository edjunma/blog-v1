summary: In my progress to master the fundamentals of programming and improving my skills in data structures and algorithms. One of the first and highest priority to learn topics in this landscape are arrays, one of the most common data structures encountered during interviews. In this post, I will take a deep dive into understanding arrays, it's pros and cons, their structures, operations, and use cases.

# Understanding Arrays

After encountering Tech Interview Handbook, I decided to write blog posts about the topics that I am studying and improving on. One of the basics of succeeding in coding interviews is understanding arrays and writing about what I've learned would certainly be beneficial to not only me but to the community.

Arrays are data structures that hold values of the same type at contiguous memory locations. In an array, we usually look for two things, the position or the index of an element and then the element itself.

## Basic Structure of Arrays üîé

For me, how I understood arrays was to visualize the data being stored in their elements. For example, visualizing your computer's memory as a grid where each piece of information on your computer is stored in countless other small squares. Arrays utilize the "grid" structure to store lists of related information in adjacent memory locations for maximum efficiency during value lookups.
