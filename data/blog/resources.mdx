# Introduction

Learning web development is difficult, which is why many people seek higher education like degrees in computer science or go to coding boot camps for guidance and support. But as a self-taught web developer, I've gone through many struggles and still do to this day. But with some grit, drive, and the tenacity to constantly learn, anything is possible! Check out some of the resources below that I've personally used and would recommend to any type or developer/engineer.

# Road Maps of Different Web Development Paths

## 1. freeCodeCamp

freeCodeCamp is a completely free resource with the glamor of certifications after completion, but the platform not only has courses on full-stack web development but also various other topics like Python data modeling and analysis, machine learning, information security, quality assurance, data visualization, and many more. I have only successfully completed the Responsive Web Design Certification but I have attempted the challenges of the other courses like the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course and it is consistently updated with valuable knowledge. There is also a huge robust community of code campers and aspiring learners where you can find support if you ever get stuck on one of the challenges. Check out their YouTube channel, subreddit, forum, and Discord server for more!

## 2. Udemy

While most of the courses on Udemy aren't free and some of the prices can even reach unfathomable numbers. There are frequent site-wide sales for countless courses filled with various content and topics especially about web development and sometimes it is possible to grab a paid course for free! Nonetheless, Udemy was one of the platforms that first got me started on learning web development, my first course was Andrei Neagoie's Zero To Mastery Web Developer course. Fantastic course filled with valuable knowledge, interactivity, a supportive community, and the ability to build your very own full-stack web application. Although most of the courses are not free there are a number of courses on this platform that if you are willing to open your wallet to will teach you invaluable knowledge and experience.

## 3. The Odin Project

The open-source Allfathers have blessed us with a free full-stack web development curriculum that has HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, Ruby/Ruby on Rails, Node.js, database technologies, and even courses on developing a portfolio, getting hired, and preparing for interviews. You'll also find a supportive community of developers on their platform and social media, check out their reddit and Discord server, and their open source code on GitHub.

## 4. Mozilla Developer Network

MDN, from the developer team that brought us the Firefox browser. Is an excellent free resource for web developers of any experience ranging from beginner to expert. This is one of the resources that I have bookmarked to look back upon for lessons that cover the core web development technologies in detail from beginner to advanced lessons in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Other important topics like web forms, web accessibility, testing, backend technologies like Python, Django, Express, and Node.js.

## 5. YouTube

The platform that has no shortage of channels of countless creators dedicated to even just the topic of web development. YouTube is a platform that I use everyday and I believe it is a goldmine of knowledge and information and it is up to you to handle what kind of content you want to see. Some of the channels that I have learned a lot from and are subscribed to are:

[Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia)

[The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja)

## 6. CS-50/ CS-50X

Free self-paced introductory computer science course offered by Harvard University that teach technologies that include C, PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. Taught by instructors David J. Malan, Doug Lloyd, and Brian Yu, teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. As I personally took the course, it was helpful in gaining solid groundwork and familiarity with computer science concepts like data structures, algorithms, abstractions, security, and web development. Course videos are free to take on your own schedule but to be eligible for an official certificate of completion, 9 programming assignments and a final project inspired by real-world problems are due at the end of the 11-week course.

## 7. JavaScript30

Created by Wes Bos, JavaScript30 was one of the ways I would say I got unstuck from "tutorial hell". It is a one-month challenge or curriculum for developers of all skill-levels to flex their JavaScript abilities by working in the DOM without a JavaScript library like React or Vue. I took on the challenge for 30 days everyday building fun interactive components with vanilla JavaScript and I have to say I don't regret taking it on at all because it gave me a more thorough understanding of basic JavaScript and its functionality/capability.

## 8. Reddit

Reddit is home to many popular web development, design, and programming subreddits. It is a great platform to find a community, ask questions, get help, share resources or even flex and show off some of your work and accomplishments. Here are some of the subreddits that I am lurking in:
