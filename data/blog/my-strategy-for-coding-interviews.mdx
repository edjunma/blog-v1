summary: Coding interviews are daunting, coming from someone that is currently studying and experiencing them now first hand. To improve my skills, I decided to jot down some of my notes in this blog post to solidify that knowledge. Hopefully some of these tips would prove to be useful to you as it did for me!

# Introduction

From experience, during the technical interview process there is always the whiteboard or code pad coding interview. Given a 45-minute time restraint to explain your thought process and attempt to solve the problem in code or pseudo code as best as you can may seem intimidating. However, working through a coding problem with the interviewer can help showcase a candidate's problem solving skills and communication skills by walking through your though process along with your interviewer.

# Breakdown

Assuming there is 45 minutes in the interview, I developed a strategy to frame out my thought process during a coding interview

## 1. Understanding the Problem (5 minutes)

Read the problem carefully, reread once more just to see if you notice any parts you don't understand which I recommend to clarify with your interviewer. Next, I would repeat the problem in my own words just to double-check my understanding of the problem and visualizing my own approach. Finally, validate any assumptions you have with your interviewer to ensure you have the right scope before tackling the problem head on.

## 2. Now Problem Solving (10-15 minutes)

Before you just throw your brain at the keyboard and start writing code, it is wise to come up with an optimal strategy on how to solve the problem.

## 3. Now Code It (20 minutes)

## 4. Double Check & Review (5 minutes)
